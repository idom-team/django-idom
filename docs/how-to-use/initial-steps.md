???+ summary

      Set up a Django Project with at least one app.

---

If you've reached this point, you should have already [installed Django-IDOM](../installation/index.md) through the previous steps.

Django provides you high flexibility on where your apps can reside.

However, for the examples within this section we will assume you've placed the files [generated by `startapp`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/#creating-the-polls-app) directly into your **Django project** folder. This is common for small projects.

??? Info "Starting from scratch"

      {% include-markdown "../installation/index.md" start="<!--dj-proj-start-->" end="<!--dj-proj-end-->" %}

      Afterwards, make sure to follow the [Django-IDOM installation instructions](../installation/index.md).

??? question "How do I organize my Django project for IDOM?"

      Django-IDOM has no requirements on file structure. Organize everything as you wish, just like any other Django project.
