## Create a Django project and app

We are going to assume you've [created a basic **Django project**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/) before, which also involves creating/installing at least one **Django app**. If not, check out this [9 minute video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsJRXS_vrw0) created by _IDG TECHtalk_.

Django provides you high flexibility on file structure for your apps. For the examples within this section, we will assume you've placed the files [generated by `startapp`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/#creating-the-polls-app) directly into your **Django project** folder. This is a common folder structure for small projects.

!!! note "Note: Django Project Structure"

      Django-IDOM has no requirements on file structure. Organize everything as you wish.

## Create a component

### `components.py`

{% include-markdown "../../README.md" start="<!--py-header-start-->" end="<!--py-header-end-->" %}

{% include-markdown "../../README.md" start="<!--py-code-start-->" end="<!--py-code-end-->" %}

!!! note "Note: File Naming"

      You can name `components.py` anything you wish, and place it within any Python module. Ultimately, components are referenced by Python dotted path in `my-template.html`. So, at minimum this path needs to be valid to Python's `importlib`.
