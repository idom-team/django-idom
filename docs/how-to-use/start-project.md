If you've reached this point, you should have already [installed Django-IDOM](../installation/index.md) through the previous steps.

Now, we are going to assume you have at least [a basic **Django project**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/) configured, which also involves creating/installing at least one **Django app**. If not, check out this [9 minute video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsJRXS_vrw0) created by _IDG TECHtalk_.

Django provides you high flexibility on file structure for your apps. For the examples within this section, we will assume you've placed the files [generated by `startapp`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/#creating-the-polls-app) directly into your **Django project** folder.

This is a common folder structure for small projects.

!!! note "Note: Django Project Structure"

      Django-IDOM has no requirements on file structure. Organize everything as you wish.
